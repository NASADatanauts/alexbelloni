    <section class='container'>
        At the end of October, I received the notification that our app is one of the global nominees in the NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2019. 
        To share my experience as a member of a virtual team, I decided to list tips to create great projects in this event.
    </section>
    <section class='container'>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Grouping up</h3>
                Before the event, at least 15 days, I recommend you start to communicate your network about the challenge through social media and other places.
                Keep in mind an ideal team has 4 or 5 members because of the hard work in the hackathon.
                Create a shared file, listing the abilities of each person who wants to participate and suggestions for their responsibilities. 
                This is the moment for analyzing hard and soft skills to balance the efforts. 
                Usually, a common hackathon team has 1 or 2 developers, a researcher, a video/image editor, and a data analyst. Of course, one person can receive more than one role.
                Finally, transfer the role to each member.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
                Commonly, the official space apps page is already updated on Monday before the event. 
                Verify the rules again, deadlines, and requirements for posting the solution.
                Based on the theme that your team chose, list ideas, texts, first impressions, issues, and links about the subjects. 
                Our team searched for old Space Apps projects on Resource Telescope which gave us some starting points. 
                Try to eliminate complex topics because of the short deadline.
                Select the best theme as soon as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Distributing tasks</h3>
                On Friday, the tasks should be distributed for each member according to their roles. 
                Create new accounts or share the profiles of communication tools such as Slack, Google Drive, and GitHub. 
                A repository of videos, like YouTube, is important to share the final pitch, as well.  
                Make sure that all member's timezones are known and schedule with some general meetings during the challenge.
                The team can start to develop the project.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Working</h3>
                Your team probably will work hard over the weekend. However, 2 days may not be enough if you are disorganized.
                 Always check the progress and each result.
                 On Sunday, in the afternoon, the final video should be ready, coding shared on Github, solution running online, and links and project description finished.
                 It's so dangerous to wait the last minute to finished anything.
            </li>           
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class='container'>
        To summarize, create a team and define each role for each member, among the best themes choose the simple but great one,  
        make sure members have their tasks and are able to communicate properly, and control the time to finish the project early. 
        I hope my experience can be helpful to your team. Good luck!
