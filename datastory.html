                    <p>Space Apps Challenge is an annual and global event by NASA that gives great opportunity to
                        participants
                        group up and present new ideas, researches, and solutions over one weekend. The winners are
                        highlighted
                        on the awards page and can be invited to visit NASA facilities.</p>
                    <p>In 2018, this 2-day hackathon grouped 18,000 participants in 75 countries. The result was a
                        collection of
                        1,375 open-source projects, and lots of links and findings of IT people, artists, designers,
                        students,
                        data scientists, enthusiasts, and others.</p>

            </div>
            <p>I participated in the last challenge and already register myself for the next event. However, the
                questions are: where do I start my project from? Where are these findings and links (previous
                discoveries)?</p>
            <div class='row'>

                <div class='col-md-9'>
                    <p>Based on the metaphor “standing on the shoulders of giants”, I’ve created a tool that focuses on
                        the reuse of projects searching for keywords over more than 5,000 solutions into 5 previous
                        challenges.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, participants can use the solutions, links, references, and ideas to
                        evolve their projects or create a completely new one from a known trail.</p>
                    <p>The tool was named “Resource Telescope” and implemented by using Nodejs, Reactjs, Firebase,
                        and Algolia.</p>
                </div>
                <div class='col-md-3'>
                    <div class='post-photo'>
                        <img src="images/giant.jpg" width='220px' height='220px' alt="alexandre belloni"
                            class="d-inline-block align-top">
                        <h6>The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants' target='_blank'>giant</a> Orion carried his Cedalion</h6>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>




            <p>The first step in the development process was making sure that the pages of the
                challenges could be read by bots. Any mention of the restrictions in using this
                information inside official pages or robots.txt file was found.</p>
            <p>Afterward, my program collected and structured links and descriptions from lots of
                pages and subpages inserting them to a NoSQL database into the Firebase platform.
                This kind of database doesn’t have full-text searching natively. Then, the Algolia
                tool was responsible to do that.</p>
            <p>Finally, my front-end application was developed using Reactjs and deployed by
                Firebase hosting. It is ready to receive keywords from inventive creators.</p>
       
                
                        <div class="text-center">
                                <a target='_blank' href='https://resource-telescope.web.app'>Resource Telescope</a>
                </div>
           
                

            <p>The 2019 challenge will be in next October. It will awesome to climb in
                tallest shoulders, use a virtual telescope, revisit links and resources, and
                start my new and funny app.</p>
            <p>Any questions about the development or my challenge experience, please,
                let me know.</p>

            The tool used links and descriptions from lots of pages and subpages inside the Space Apps environment
