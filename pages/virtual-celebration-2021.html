            On March 12, the NASA Space Apps team, and the winning participants from the past three hackathons - Space
            Apps 2019, 2020, and the COVID-19 version - celebrated all their achievements. The virtual celebration
            presented us with awesome projects, teams from around the world, scientists, officers, and NASA experts
            together. The result of that reveals the huge effort of this group and helps us to prepare for the next
            challenge. Therefore, I'd like to summarize the main points and the event rundown below.
        </div>
        <h3>Welcome and Space Apps Story</h3>
        <div>
            In the beginning, the Global Organization (GO) Team members, <b>Valeria Gonzalez</b> and <b>Yasha Moz</b> introduced the
            topics of the meeting. The first speaker was the leader of the GO team, <b>Sarah Hemmings</b>, who talked to us
            about the Space Apps story and numbers. She mentioned that over 250 local events, and 2 international
            hackathons - COVID-19 and the regular versions - were accomplished in 2020. Other facts:
        </div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>India and Brazil had more local events among 80+ countries</li>
                <li>Egypt had the largest events in Alexandria and Kairo</li>
                <li>Since 2012, the event aims to use NASA data and engages STEM education</li>
                <li>The first event included participation in Antarctica and the ISS</li>
                <li>71 million #spaceapps hashtags were posted on social media platforms</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            The partnership summed 4 agencies: European Space Agency, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Canadian Space
            Agency, and Centre National DÃ‰tudes Spatiales. It was essential to share lots of new datasets, APIs, and
            tools with participants.
            <b>Sandra Cauffman</b>, the deputy director of the Earth science division, gave us more updates and congratulated
            the quality of the projects and diversity of themes.
        </div>
        <h3>Forging the Future of Science at NASA</h3>
        <div>
            <b>Dr. James Green</b>, the chief scientist of NASA, guided us through the global measurements such as water
            & energy cycle, atmospheric composition, and climate variability, available today or soon via public
            datasets. Furthermore, he explained several aspects of the recent achievement on Mars with the Perseverance
            rover and the mission Artemis that will land humans and other rovers on the Moon in 2024.
            Afterwards, Dr. Green answered some questions. I asked if Curiosity and Perseverance can communicate with
            each other directly. In a nutshell, the distance between the rovers is huge like the USA and France.
            Therefore, "communication" is done by humans from Earth.
        </div>
        <h3>Q&A Session</h3>
        <div>
            <b>Dr. Thomas Zurbuchen</b>, the NASA administrator for the science mission, praised the Space Apps event and its
            participants who present innovative ideas and creative solutions leading engagement with science. He
            received some questions including the future relationship between winning teams and NASA. He suggested
            people join NASA communities and search for information about internships.
        </div>
        <h3>Launchpad to Success</h3>
        <div>
            NASA engineer <b>Zaida Hernandez</b> taught about her path to working for NASA and opportunities to strengthen
            STEAM skills and space science.
        </div>
        <div>
            <b>Dr. Shobhana Gupta</b>, Open Innovation & Community Applications Manager from NASA, led a discussion on project
            development after the hackathon weekend. She showed the steps of the project lifecycle from the definition
            and prototyping, the MVP during the hackathon, to the incubation and acceleration process. It's essentially
            a startup challenge. Teams need to continue the development and present their product to lots of people,
            identify the customers and users, the market, and so on.
        </div>
        <h3>Beyond the Horizon</h3>
        <div>
            At the end of the celebration event, <b>Nick Fox</b>, Heliophysics Division director, <b>Paul Hertz</b>, director of the
            Astrophysics Division, and <b>Lori Glaze</b>, director of Planetary Science Division, gave us an overview about
            those areas, the 2020 highlights, and the future explorations. It was mentioned themes like The Solar
            Orbiter, Parker Solar Probe, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope related to Dark Energy, Dark Matter, and
            other cosmology subjects.
        </div>
        <h3>Networking</h3>
        <div>
            The last session was networking where it was the opportunity to meet NASA officers, teams, and projects. The
            link for the Virtual Awards Ceremony page is in the area below.
        </div>
        <div>
            The NASA Space Apps Challenge has been an awesome one-weekend hackathon. However, the challenge can continue
            depending on each teams and their engagements. The celebration event showed the efforts of the organization,
            scientists, and officers to teach, share knowledge, and support participants and their solutions from the
            idea to the possible final product.
        </div>
        <div>
            I hope this summary can encourage you to subscribe to the next Space Apps Challenge on October 2-3, 2021.
        </div>
        <div>
            Thanks, <b>GO team</b> and <b>NASA officers</b> for this amazing event!
