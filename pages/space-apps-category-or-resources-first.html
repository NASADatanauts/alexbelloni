            An awesome result in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/">Space Apps Challenge</a> depends on the correct submission of our project at the end.
            According to my experience, I sketched a guideline and decision tree to help teams when classifying their solutions.
        </div>
        <div>
            Before thinking about categories and challenges, we should understand what are the
            rules to apply a project such as deadlines, team formation, and submission
            requirements. As a Space Apps ambassador, I saw some teams subscribing to their ideas inappropriately. It can
            declassify all work.
        </div>
        <div>My suggestion is to read the 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://sa-2019.s3.amazonaws.com/media/documents/Space_Apps_2020_Participant_FAQ.pdf">Participant FAQ</a> 
            first. Mainly for beginners, the instinct leads us to jump to the development phase quickly but a good decision is
            planning the journey.
        </div>
        <div>
            Afterwards, we should read the category and challenge <a href="https://2020.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/" traget="_blank">descriptions</a> carefully using the official portal. This
            step gives us a preview of the themes and it can ease the choices.
        </div>
        <div>
            In my view, the solution depends on the type of deliverable and the number of
            fonts or resources which we'll use in our project. Generally speaking, a great set of
            materials like APIs, datasets, and articles should be one priority.
            I created a visual guide to indicate when choosing the category of the project.
        </div>
        <div>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dnzozanco/image/upload/v1599834214/blogbanners/diagram_cs1hdg.jpg" style="width:100%;border-radius:3px;" />
        </div>
        <div>
            Based on the previous <a href="https://covid19.spaceappschallenge.org/" target="_blank">COVID-19 challenge</a>, the May version of the Space Apps global hackathon, I supposed
            some examples.
        </div>
        <div style="padding-left:15px;">
            <div><img src="../images/spaceapps_dot.png" />
                If our goal was creating a painting, the only possible category was 
                "The Art of It All" and the path is the
                number one in the diagram. The development was immediate with just one reference.
                Our deliverable and resource, in this scenery, was a picture and an article, video, or interview for
                instance, in other words, one official material and our quarantine experience.
            </div>
            <div> In this case, <a href="https://2020.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/create/create-mascot/details" target="_blank">"Create a Mascot"</a> is one of the options for artists in the October challenge.
            </div>
            <div style="border:thin dashed; padding:5px; font-size:18px;">
                Important reminder: It is mandatory to use at least one space agency's reference in your project. 
                NASA, CSA, CNES, and JAXA are the official agencies for the Space Apps Challenge 2020. This <a href="https://nasadatanauts.github.io/alexbelloni/pages/capsule-websites.html" traget="_blank">huge list</a> has lots of initial references. 
            </div>
            <div><img src="../images/spaceapps_dot.png" />
                If our project was assembling hardware using a known model or procedure and the work was previously in
                course, our path is number two. Hardware in a virtual event is understood as a plan or schema :). The choices as categories could be "Purify the Air
                Supply" or "The Isolation Solution".
                Here, the new equipment is the result and one page or a PDF step-by-step file the reference.
            </div>
            <div>
                The similar challenge is <a href="https://2020.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/create/virtual-planetary-exploration/details" target="_blank">"Virtual Planetary Exploration"</a>.
            </div>
            <div><img src="../images/spaceapps_dot.png" />
                Another possibility could be to present an innovative form of data visualization by using just one big
                dataset. In this case, just one resource. Our category could be "Where There’s a Link, There’s a Way",
                following the path three.
                Therefore, we could submit a new 3D visualization based on an official dataset.
            </div>
            <div>
                 <a href="https://2020.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/observe/hey-heasarc/details" target="_blank">"Hey! What Are You Looking At?"</a> can be our option for visualization tools.
            </div>
            <div><img src="../images/spaceapps_dot.png" />
                However, a frequent situation is having a new solution and a group of resources. The problem here is linking
                the resources to create a deliverable. Then, my suggestion is, before choosing a category, we should find
                and link the resources. The diagram guides us to the fourth path.
                As an example, our product could be a timelapse by location showing the relationship between human activities and levels of
                chemical elements in the air. Maybe, the category was "Light the Path".
            </div>
            <div>
                A valid choice of challenge is <a href="https://2020.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/observe/one-health-approach/details" target="_blank">"A One Health Approach"</a>, which integrates different types of datasets and applications.
           </div>
        </div>
        
        <div>These situations are examples of how to use the diagram. The goal of this decision tree is to make sure that we are confident to start our project. Nevertheless, it is just a suggestion. Sure, there are exceptions. </div>
        <div>
            In summary, the correct moment to choose the category and challenge, and start the development can leverage
            our project submission and give us a real chance to win an award in the hackathon. 
        </div>
        <div>Follow the guideline and create an excellent solution.
        </div>
        <div>
            I hope my guide and diagram help your team over the event.
        </div>
        <div>
            Good hackathon and take action<img src="../images/exclamation.png" />
        </div>
        <div style="border:thin dashed; padding:5px; font-size:18px;">
            PS: You should use my tool named <a href="https://resource-telescope.web.app/" target="_blank">"Resource Telescope"</a> to seach for resources from previous projects over the Space Apps environment and favorite them. The resources used for other project can help your team when selecting references and materials.
