            An awesome result in the event depends on the correct submission at the end.
            According to my experience, I sketched a guideline to help teams when classifying their solutions.
        </div>
        <div>
            Before thinking about categories and challenges, we should understand what are the
            rules to apply a project such as deadlines, team formation, and submission
            requirements. As a Space Apps ambassador, I saw some teams subscribing to their ideas inappropriately. It can
            declassify all work.
        </div>
        <div>My suggestion is to read the Participant FAQ first. Our instinct is going to do things but a good start is
            planning the journey.
        </div>
        <div>
            Afterwards, we should read the category and challenge descriptions carefully using the official portal. It
            step can ease the choices.
        </div>
        <div>
            In my view, the solution depends on the type of deliverable and the number of
            fonts or resources which we'll use in our project. Generally speaking, if you have anything, a great set of
            materials like APIs, datasets, and articles should be one priority.
            I create a visual guide to help us to start the development through the diagram below.
        </div>
        <div>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dnzozanco/image/upload/v1599834214/blogbanners/diagram_cs1hdg.jpg" style="width:100%;border-radius:3px;" />
        </div>
        <div>
            Based on the previous COVID-19 challenge, the May version of the Space Apps global hackathon, I supposed
            some examples.
        </div>
        <div><img src="../images/spaceapps_dot.png" />
            If our goal was creating a painting, the only possible category was 
            "The Art of It All" and the path is the
            number one in the diagram. The development was immediate with just one reference.
            Our deliverable and resource, in this scenery, was a picture and an article, video, or interview for
            instance, in other words, one official material and our quarantine experience.
        </div>
        <div style="border:thin dashed; padding:5px; font-size:18px;">
            Important reminder: It is mandatory to use at least one space agency's reference in your project. 
            NASA, CSA, CNES, and JAXA are the official agencies for the Space Apps Challenge 2020.
        </div>
        <div><img src="../images/spaceapps_dot.png" />
            If our project was assembling hardware using a known model or procedure and the work was previously in
            course, our path is number two. Hardware in a virtual event is understood as a plan or schema :). The choices as categories could be "Purify the Air
            Supply" or "The Isolation Solution".
            Here, the new equipment is the result and one page or a PDF step-by-step file the reference.
        </div>
        <div><img src="../images/spaceapps_dot.png" />
            Another possibility could be to present an innovative form of data visualization by using just one big
            dataset. In this case, just one resource. Our category could be "Where There’s a Link, There’s a Way",
            following the path three.
            Therefore, we could submit a new 3D visualization based on an official dataset.
        </div>
        <div><img src="../images/spaceapps_dot.png" />
            However, a frequent situation is having a new solution and a group of resources. The problem here is linking
            the resources to create a deliverable. Then, my suggestion is, before choosing a category, we should find
            and link the resources. The diagram guides us to the fourth path.
            As an example, our product could be a timelapse by location showing the relationship between human activities and levels of
            chemical elements in the air. Maybe, the category was "Light the Path".
        </div>
        <div>These situations are examples of how to use the diagram. It is just a suggestion. Sure, there are exceptions. </div>
        <div>
            In summary, the correct order of choosing the category and the resources, and starting the development can leverage
            our project submission and give us a real chance to win an award in the hackathon. Follow the guideline and create an excellent solution.
        </div>
        <div>
            I hope my guide and diagram help your team over the event.
