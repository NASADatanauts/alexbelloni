                <h3>Starting</h3>
                In 2017, I started seeking opportunities to work on volunteer projects. Searching for remote or on-site places, I found a blog post by a group of studies in Data Science from NASA. They needed all-level data scientists and developers to help 
                <b>NASA's Open Innovation team</b> to share knowledge, learn and teach data science and collaborating to the company. I applied for one of the 50 spots worldwide. The selection process is internal and panel-based in which the committee reviews and rates applications. After a month, I received the invite to participate in the NASA Datanauts group as a member of the 
                <b>Spring Class</b>.

                <h3>Lessons and Tracks</h3>
                The first step was doing lessons at specific tracks. Among some options such as 3D data modeling, data mining, and math equations, I decided my focus. I followed initial lessons that presented tech tools for sharing content like GitHub and its gh-pages. While doing my homework, I saw that an 
                <b>API lesson for beginners was not available</b>. Then, I suggested it. The project manager loved my idea.

            <li>
                <h3>My Tutorial</h3>
                After a week, I concluded a 
                <b>tutorial about API</b> that used datasets, a database, and a webpage to show an interesting subject: near-Earth comets. Many members learned the content through my live guideline. It's awesome receiving feedbacks! For IT people, the tutorial used NASA API portal, Firebase, and Javascript.
            </li>

                <h3>Watercooler</h3>
                As result of my approach, Veronica Phillip and Elyssa, group managers, invited me to participate in the virtual event named 'water-cooler meeting'. It was a great 
                <b>30-minute opportunity</b> to teach my tutorial, step by step. Some members and I created a page that presented comets' data in a structured view and searching tool. 
                This presentation received excellent feedbacks from students and NASA officers such as Beth Beck, the <b>Open Innovation program manager</b>, and David Meza, 
                the <b>Chief Knowledge Architect</b>. So, there was a brainstorm of new ideas for new lessons based on my tutorial.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Others</h3>
                Afterward, I've worked on several projects such as the catalog of members, new features on a visual program about orbital trajectories, and solutions in the NASA Space Apps challenges. I'm glad to have my contributions published in this community such as "Datanauts Community Shout Outs!" magazine and <a target="_blank" href="https://open.nasa.gov/data-stories/the-resource-telescope/">OpenNASA stories</a>. 
                I hope I can continue providing my help for this amazing Datanauts group.
