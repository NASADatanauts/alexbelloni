            After being a Datanauts <a href='stepbystep.html'>member</a> for 3 years, having contributed to <a href='projects.html'>projects</a>, and participating in lots of challenges within NASA programs, I'm so glad to get another
            important title in this path, Space Apps Challenge Ambassador.

                <h3>What is it?</h3>
                Space Apps Ambassadors are volunteers that coordinate and bolster engagement in NASA's International Space Apps Challenge. This annual event also is known as the world's largest global hackathon is executed by NASA HQ along with GO Team, and volunteer local hosts. Participants choose a scope to develop innovative solutions using NASA's open data. The purpose is to inspire collaboration, creativity, critical thinking, and interest of the next generation of scientists, technologists, designers, engineers, and artists in Earth, space science, and exploration around the world. In 2020, the event has two versions in May and October: COVID-19 and the regular one. The first one had 15,000+ participants and 1,300+ selected projects, which it was successful compared to its previous regular version with 29,000+ registrants, and 2,000+ projects.

                <h3>Roles</h3>
                The roles of the ambassadors include spending around 30 hours with orientation webinars along with organizers and subject matter experts, moderating chats with teams over the event, supporting participants to find resources and answers for their questions, and sharing information onto social media about Space Apps. Another interesting task is to record a 5-15 minute video for the virtual Bootcamp providing people with our expertise in NASA data and hackathons. After a few days, the volunteer reviews the submitted solutions and supports judging for the hackathon.

                <h3>Rocket Chat</h3>
                The event had 12 challenges, which suggested subjects around the impact of the pandemic worldwide. During the event, I saw lots of participants questioning about psychological research or data, complex datasets, and conversion of data format, on the public chat page. In addition to games, websites, and charts, people were creating movies, scripts, animations, and poems. It's so amazing! The direct messages were interesting too. Many teams were requesting feedbacks for their projects in progress. It's a good practice making sure about the requirements. In the private room, other ambassadors, organizers, local leaders, and experts kept sharing problems, and useful answers and comments. The communication was intense. At the end of Sunday, despite the hard work, I was very happy helping the event.

        My 3-year experience as a Datanaut and hackathon competitor guided me to this role. I like so much to coordinate, moderate, and support this fantastic space enthusiast meeting as a volunteer. Despite the distancing, the close contact with others via chat was wonderful. Being an ambassador of this kind of event has been a great badge to mark my effort in the NASA programs.
