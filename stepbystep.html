                <h3>Being a member</h3>
                In 2017, I started finding opportunities to work on volunteer projects. Searching for remote or on-site places, I found a blog post by a group of studies in Data Science from NASA. They needed all-level data scientists and developers to help 
                <b>NASA's Open Innovation team</b> to share knowledge, learn and teach data science and collaborating to the company. I applied for one of the 50 spots worldwide. After a month, I received the invite to participate in the NASA Datanauts group as a member of the 
                <b>Spring Class</b>.

                <h3>Lessons and Tracks</h3>
                The first step was doing lessons at specific tracks. Among some options such as 3D data modeling, data mining, and math equations, I decided my focus. I followed initial lessons that presented tech tools for sharing content like Git and its gh-pages. While doing my homework, I saw that an 
                <b>API lesson for beginners was not available</b>. Then, let's do it. The project manager loved my idea.

                <h3>My Tutorial</h3>
                After a week, I concluded a 
                <b>tutorial about API</b> that used datasets, a database, and a webpage to show an interesting subject: near-Earth comets. Many members learned it through my live guideline. It's awesome receiving feedbacks! For IT people, the tutorial used NASA API portal, Firebase, and Javascript.

                <h3>Watercooler</h3>
                Veronica Phillip and Elyssa, group managers, invited me to participate in a talk named 'water-cooler meeting'. It was a great 
                <b>30-minute opportunity</b> to teach my tutorial in person. Some members and I created a page that presented comets' data in a structured view and searching tool. Further receiving feedback from students, some NASA officers such as Beth Beck, Open Innovation program manager, and David Meza, 
                <b>Chief Knowledge Architect</b>, asked me questions and comments. At last minutes, there was a brainstorm of new ideas for new lessons based on my presentation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Others</h3>
                Afterward, I helped David to improve the catalog of members, added new features on a visual program about orbital trajectories, and applied a new project to the NASA Space Apps 2018. I'm glad to have my work published in one of the editions of the "Datanauts Community Shout Outs!" magazine. Therefore, I keep helping the Open Innovation program, and Technology and Innovation Division creating new tutorials and a new group Datanauts' members portal.
